Conference report-style paper exploring load balancing in the containerised cloud ecosystem.

Development

You should install a LaTeX editor to easily work on the paper:
 - TeXShop is one of the best OS X LaTeX editors out there, http://pages.uoregon.edu/koch/texshop/obtaining.html (I used v3.56 in the making of the initial paper template)
 - TeXMaker seems to be the best editor out there for Windows, http://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/

Members getting started with LaTeX can find plenty of resources out there:
 - Classic HelloWorld example, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQl2XdBiWNE
 - How bibliographies work, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRXvqthfDG0

Members working on the paper can use their LaTeX editors to do the hard work:
 - open the report's `.tex` and `.bib` files
 - compile the `.tex` document with the `LaTeX` typeset
 - compile the `.bib` document with the `BibTeX` typeset (Note, if you now see a compiled PDF but citations do not appear you may need to then compile the `.tex` document twice again, see http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/53235/why-does-latex-bibtex-need-three-passes-to-clear-up-all-warnings)
